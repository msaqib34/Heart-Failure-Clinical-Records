# Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset

This repository contains code for importing, cleaning, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and building predictive models on the Heart Failure Clinical Records dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Heart Failure Clinical Records dataset. It contains various clinical features that can be used to predict the likelihood of heart failure in patients.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- Imbalanced-learn (imblearn): For handling imbalanced datasets.

## Models Used
The following classification algorithms are used for building predictive models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Extra Trees Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes

## Evaluation Metrics
The following evaluation metrics are used to assess model performance:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score

## Additional Notes
- Due to class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is used to handle the imbalance in the dataset.
